# Basys3Clock

Within this lab, we will design a digital clock that features a ‘set feature’ and ‘alarm feature’. Three modes are required: clock counting mode with alarm off, alarm setting mode, and clock counting mode with alarm on. The digital clock will be implemented on the Basys3 where the 7 segment display is needed, one switch button to set alarm mode, and a few LEDs to represent that the alarm went off.
